    <h2> Cotton</h2>
    <h4>Introdution</h4>
       <p>Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. The fiber is almost pure cellulose, and can contain minor percentages of waxes, fats, pectins, and water. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.</p>
    
    
    
       <h4>Etymology</h4>
          <p>The word "cotton" has Arabic origins, derived from the Arabic word قطن (qutn or qutun). This was the usual word for cotton in medieval Arabic.[5] Marco Polo in chapter 2 in his book, describes a province he calls Khotan in Turkestan, today's Xinjiang, where cotton was grown in abundance. The word entered the Romance languages in the mid-12th century,[6] and English a century later. Cotton fabric was known to the ancient Romans as an import, but cotton was rare in the Romance-speaking lands until imports from the Arabic-speaking lands in the later medieval era at transformatively lowered prices.[7][8]</p>
    
    
        <h4>Types</h4>
          <p>There are four commercially grown species of cotton, all domesticated in antiquity:
    
            Gossypium hirsutum – upland cotton, native to Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and southern Florida (90% of world production)[citation needed]
            Gossypium barbadense – known as extra-long staple cotton, native to tropical South America (8% of world production)[citation needed]
            Gossypium arboreum – tree cotton, native to India and Pakistan (less than 2%)
            Gossypium herbaceum – Levant cotton, native to southern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (less than 2%)</p>
